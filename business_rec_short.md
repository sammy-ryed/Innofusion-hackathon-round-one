## E-Commerce Consumer Behavior Analysis

### 1. 🔁 Redesign the Loyalty Program
Members spend **$27 less** per purchase than non-members — the program attracts bargain-hunters, not high-value customers. Shift to a **tiered structure** (Silver/Gold/Platinum) with exclusive perks and points multipliers on full-price purchases instead of blanket discounts.

### 2. 🎯 Target Discounts by Sensitivity Segment
52% of customers use discounts, but sensitivity varies widely (25% → 85% usage rate). Stop offering discounts to "Not Sensitive" customers — focus codes and triggers only on **Very Sensitive** and **Somewhat Sensitive** groups to protect margins.

### 3. 📱 Prioritize Mobile & Online Experience
65% of purchases happen online, yet mobile accounts for only 10% of sales — a clear gap. Invest in **one-click checkout, Apple/Google Pay, and PWA** to realistically double the mobile share.

### 4. 📣 Invest in Social Commerce
High social media influence correlates with **12% higher spending**. Launch Instagram Shop, run micro-influencer partnerships (10K–50K followers), and add social proof widgets — targeting a **3–5x ROAS**.

### 5. 🧪 A/B Test Pricing — Don't Guess
The model predicts discount usage at only **51% accuracy**, meaning current data can't explain what drives it. Run controlled tests: flash sales vs. week-long promos, threshold discounts vs. percentage-off, and personalized welcome offers to build real evidence.

### 6. 📊 Collect Better Data
Poor model accuracy signals **data gaps**. Start capturing browsing history, cart abandonment reasons, email engagement, and device/location signals. Goal: push predictive accuracy to **70–80% within 6 months**.

**Bottom line:** Stop blanket discounts. Fix loyalty. Go mobile. Test everything.
